**Design a Set of Colored Boxes**

Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.



In this lab, you'll practice using CSS colors by designing boxes.



**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.



**User Stories:**



1. You should set the background color for body to #f4f4f4.
2. You should have a div with a class of color-grid to hold all your color elements.
3. You should have five div elements within the .color-grid element.
4. The five div elements should each have a class of color-box and color#, where # is the number of the order of that div. For example: color1 for the first div, color2 for the second, and so on.
5. The .color-box class should have a set width and height so your div elements are visible on the page.
6. The .color1 element should have a background-color that uses hexadecimal color value.
7. The .color2 element should have a background-color that uses an RGB color value.
8. The .color3 element should have a background-color that uses a predefined (word) color value.
9. The .color4 element should have a background-color that uses a HSL color value.
10. The .color5 element should have a background-color set.

**Note:** Be sure to link your stylesheet in your HTML and apply your CSS.
